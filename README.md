# Veg App frontend React SPA        

26/02/23:       
- `create-react-app` used to set up project.        
- Faintly horrifying AI-generated background image added from [_Fotor_](http://fotor.com/).            
- _MUI_ default install completed.      
- Breathtakingly professional logo created by [_LOGO_](https://app.logo.com/).     
- MUI sign up template added.       

27/02/23:       
- `react-router-dom` installed, MUI sign in template also added. _Having some intial difficulty nesting routes within routes (specifically `/auth` for Auth-main component and then onto child components for sign in and sign up.)_.       
- Clearly quite rusty in this regard: quickly realised I should not be using `<Router>` elements in child components... Thanks to the [tutorial here](https://dev.to/tywenk/how-to-use-nested-routes-in-react-router-6-4jhd) I was able to get things working as intended.
